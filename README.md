Hi,

this is my EMI - Pokedex. This is a nextjs project for learning purposes. For me it is a little recap, what i have learned in the Webdevelopers Bootcamp from NeueFische. In the folders you will find a instructions-English.md. You also can only get this and build the whole project by yourself. I have tried to explain everey step i did. ðŸ˜… You also need then the images under /public/instruction_images to display the instructions correctly.

For now this pokedex is very lame. It only shows 6 Pokemon per page with the name and the image. I used the [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/) for this. You can load more Pokemon with the next button. In the future i will try to implement a search.

This project uses:

- nextjs
- swr
- styled components

That is how it looks right now:
